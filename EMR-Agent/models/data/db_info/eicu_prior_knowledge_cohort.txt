1. Note that all time information is recorded as minute-level offsets relative to the ICU admission time.
2. Thus for hour-level features, you need to prepare the data by converting the minute-level offsets to hour-level offsets.
3. Unitvisitnumber or patienthealthsystemstayid is NOT the patient's lifetime admission count but the number of ICU stays during one hospital admission (uniquepid is for lifetime admission count).
4. The age column is stored as a string (or numeric but needs validation), cast it to text and apply a regular expression check.
5. Apache related tables are all excluded to avoid confusion. Thus do not consider any apache related tables.
