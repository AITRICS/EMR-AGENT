=== SICDB Tables Information ===



[Welcome to SICdb Documentation]
The SICdb dataset provides insight to over 27 thousand intensive care admissions, including therapy and data of their preceding surgery. Data was collected between 2013 and 2021 from 4 of the intensive care units at the University Hospital Salzburg, having more than 3 thousand intensive care admissions per year on 41 beds. The dataset is deidentified and contains, amongst others, case information, laboratory, medication, monitor and respirator signal data.SICdb provides aggregated once-per-hour and highly granular once-per-minute data.
The dataset, version 1.0.8, includes data from more than 27,350 admissions to the Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine at the General Hospital Salzburg and Paracelsus Medical University.


[Data Tables]
The SICdb dataset consists of billions of data entries across 7 data tables. The main table, "cases," contains a single entry for each intensive care admission and includes information about the patient (such as age, weight, and sex) and case details (such as diagnosis, scores, and ICD10 codes). The "TimeOfStay" field indicates the time from the first admission to a Metavision-enabled ward to the final closing of the case, including any preceding surgery. The "OffsetOfDeath" field indicates survival in seconds from admission. This data represents in-hospital mortality and may extend beyond the length of the intensive care stay or the current hospital stay. Personal data such as age, weight, and height have been grouped into bins of 5, with ages over 90 placed in the final bin.
All other data tables are related to the "cases" table through the "CaseID" field. Most data has timing information, with the "offset" field indicating the number of seconds from admission to the time of the event. The "laboratory" table contains laboratory values and the "medication" table provides data on administered drugs. There are several generic data tables that contain data sorted by type. The "data_ref" table contains additional nominal/categorical data, one entry per admission, and the "data_range" table documents items with a start and end time, such as data on central lines or drainages. The "data_float_h" table contains float data, aggregated once per hour, and includes most signal data. To reduce table size, minute data is serialized as a stream of IEEE 754 floats in the "data_float_h.rawdata" field. For further instructions on using this data, see the documentation found in Documentation.pdf or online [7], and refer to the unpacking script example provided on our GitHub repository [8].


[Reference Table]
Nominal data is encoded, and the reference table "d_references" provides additional information about the associated field. The referenced fields in all data tables correspond to the primary key of the "d_references" table, "ReferenceGlobalID." The "ReferenceValue" field in "d_references" gives the variable's value, and the "ReferenceUnit" field holds the unit or measurement, if applicable.


[Data Format]
GZip-compressed RFC 4180 comma-separated files are provided. The most current documentation, including table schemas, can be found online , and an offline copy is included in the files under the name Documentation.pdf. A GitHub repository has been created to share code, report issues, and discuss the dataset.

Get Started From SICDB Doc   Introduction SICdb dataset and the documentation, as of 04/24, in active development. We try to improve our project as fast as we can! Please contact us for every problem with data or software you find! We'd love to find some motivated researchers attain as much as possible from our dataset. Contact us if you face any issues! 
The SICdb dataset is provided in compressed .csv files, the minute values are even more consolidated. Refer to the File List for detailed description of files. 
The SICdb dataset contains billions of entries, therefore building up a database may present a challenge.  Usage Examples

- Data Description
 

Data Description From SICDB Doc   The SICdb dataset consists of multiple tables. The main tables are  cases,  d_references,  medication, data_float_h and data_ref. 
Each admission creates one entry in table  cases and data is relationally connected via the field CaseID, which is available in each of the related tables. Time values are stored in field offset, which is time in seconds from admission. 
Nearly all fields in the SICdb dataset, that can be encoded, are referenced in d_references, where field ReferenceGlobalID is related to specified field.

Case Selection
The SICdb dataset contains all admissions to metavision, that were treated on an intensive care unit. This includes patients that are admitted post-surgery as well as internal medicine cases. Note that non-surgical reasons for admission are highly underrepresentated in this dataset because most internal medicine patients are treated on a unit not using an electric PDMS. 
All admissions to participating intensiv care units are included, as long as following conditions do not apply: Less the 10 minutes of Stay
Missing mandatory admission data
No monitor signals
No medication data
hospital number mismatch
Intensive care or intermediate care?
To provide as much data as possible all patients admitted to one of our intensive or intermediate care units are included. While the associated beds have a designated care level, the patients treatment level is not defined and are treated according to their needs, they may be transferred multiply between the strongly cooperating units. In general, patients that are uniquely associated (see unitlog) to INIC or INID did not receive high level intensive care treatment. Please note that the field cases.HospitalUnit gives no information about the level of intensive care a patient received. We may provide a preprocessed field in future versions of the SICdb dataset concerning the level of treatment. Unit Description
The participating metavision enabled wards are CWIN, INBD, INIC, and INIC. INCV and CWCV are used for cases associated with SARS-COV-2, this includes SARS-COV-2 ARDS and patients with coincidental positive test and other cause of intensive care. CWIN and INBD, INCV and CWCVC are high level intensive care units. INIC and INID are lower level of care and do not provide invasive mechanical ventilation (NIV possible on INID, HFNC on all wards), CRRT or ECMO.  
Validation
All cases are cross-matched with a second database. In case of unsuccessful matching, cases were excluded, as these refer to entries for testing and demo.  
The dataset is in constant development. Feel free to contact us when you find a significant amount of invalid data.   Retrieved from "https://www.sicdb.com/wiki/index.php?title=Case_Description&oldid=378"

Case Data From SICDB Doc   "The "cases" table is the base table of the SICdb dataset and the "CaseID" field serves as the identifier that relates all data. Each admission to the intensive care unit generates a unique "CaseID." To identify readmissions, a "PatientID" is provided. The "OffsetAfterFirstAdmission" field stores the time between the first admission and the current one.
"TimeOfStay" is the time in seconds from the admission recorded by the MetaVision system to the discharge. This time may include any preceding surgery and ends when the case is closed.
There are three fields indicating survival: "DischargeState" indicates the patient's state upon discharge from the ICU and is taken from the MetaVision discharge form. "HospitalDischargeType" provides information on how the case was closed in the clinical information system. "OffsetOfDeath" is the time in seconds from admission to death and includes additional hospital stays and out of hospital mortality. As it refers to a 1-year mortality it is set to null if death occurred more than one year after admission. 
* These fields are not available on PhysioNet at the moment. Contact us for further information.
** These fields will be moved to data tables in version 1.1.0 Linked Data
Additional data to the case can be found in data_ref, which may have one entry per case and item type.
Several fields have been preprocessed and added to the database. This includes peprocessed-for-convenience and preprocessed-for-anonymization elements. The data is found in data_ref.csv.gz, the text values are referenced in d_references, where d_references.ReferenceGlobalID relates to data_ref. FieldID and data_ref.RefID.  
Known Limitations
Time of stay
In most cases at a readmission in same hospital stay a new case is created. In rare cases the preceding case is reopened causing that TimeOfStay includes the time patient was on normal ward. If this issue is important you may use the tranfer log or the lacking monitor signals to remove/repair these cases. This issue is on ToDo list for future releases   Retrieved from "https://www.sicdb.com/wiki/index.php?title=Case_Data&oldid=288"

Signal Data From SICDB Doc   Data Description
Various types of signal data has been included in the SICDb dataset. Signal data is saved in data_float_h table, value reference is found in d_references.
Important note: Data stored in data_float_h is aggregated hourly data.  Predefined Fields (RooDataServer) Contains hourly float data associated with a case. If more (minute) data is available, data was aggregated and the corresponding values are stored in rawdata field. Refer to Deserialize Raw Data for more information. Metavision does, in database, not differentiate between qualitative (i.e. blood pressure) and quantitative (i.e. drainage volume) data, this was done programatically saving the sum instead of average. The field cnt indicates the amount of values aggregated.

Medication Data From SICDB Doc   Contents 1 Data Description
2 Predefined Fields (RoDataServer)
3 Known Limitations 3.1 Offsets and Times
3.2 Different Reference for similar drugs  
Data Description
Contains all medication given during stay. Additional data like name and unit of measurement is found in d_references, where medication.DrugID is associated to d_references.ReferenceGlobalID. Metavision does not differ between continuous or single doses in rangesignals, so a single dose is set to 60 second admission time. Each change of a continuous application will end the current entry and create a new one.  
Predefined Fields (RoDataServer)
Known Limitations
The medication data is generally considered as being widely valid. Nevertheless there are some limitations to be stated: Offsets and Times
The offset is the documented time of drug application. As the observed intensive care unity do not use perfusor telemetry all values are entered manually. Following inaccuracies of of time give may be generally expected: +/- 5 minutes in anaesthesia settings
+/- 5 minutes in resuscitation settings
+/- 15 minutes in intensive care settings
The difference is explained in different default view range in medication input forms. Different Reference for similar drugs
Due to liberal laws concerning drug names in Austria not all drugs are correctly labeled by their INN name and sometimes multiple proprietary products for the same substance are used. The SICDB Team used an algorithm to identify and unify the medication data. There may be special cases where this procedure failed, for example at compound antihypertensive drugs.

Reference Table From SICDB Doc   The d_references table contains information on all encoded data fields of the SICdb dataset. Each field, that has "Reference" as field type, is associated with the ReferenceGlobalID in the d_references table. Additionally ReferenceUnit describes the unit of measurement used for this field. Refer to chapter SQL Examples to learn how to easily use this table in relational databases. 
Contents 1 Usage Information 1.1 SQL
1.2 RooDataServer 
2 Note 
Usage Information
d_references is the dictionary for all encoded data.  SQL
Use a join query to get the reference value. 
Example:  SELECT Sex,sRef.ReferenceValue as SexCaption FROM `cases` LEFT JOIN d_references as sRef ON SexRef.ReferenceGlobalID = cases.Sex; For more examples read  the  SQL Examples section RooDataServer
 ReferenceSelection
All fields using references provide simple filters to select references. 
On export RooDataServer will per default export the text value of an encoding. 
Note
To reduce the amount of tables there is no table describing references as there is no significant gain of information expected. This may change in later versions of dataset. To enumerate a reference use table d_references.ReferenceName, which is an immutable, case sensitive key to a reference.   Retrieved from "https://www.sicdb.com/wiki/index.php?title=Reference_Table&oldid=283"

While the raw Dataset in CSV files provides all possibilities to analyse and process data, it may be more convenient to browse in a fully configured and optimized database.
The SICdb Team provides a software environment to quickly select, view and export data from the database in various formats.
RooDataServer is a specific software created to access medical datasets like the SICDB Dataset.
